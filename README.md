### Projects that use nmp need to be initialized. To initialize the project - enter the following command in the terminal:

### Webpack is a modular bundler that allows you to bundle the resources and libraries you need for your project into a single file. Together with it, add the necessary loaders and plugins.

In my case, I used: _babel-core, babel-loader, babel-preset-env, babel-preset-react, clean-webpack-plugin, copy-webpack-plugin, css-loader, file-loader, html-webpack-plugin,style-loader, webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, react, react-dom._
Detailed settings can be found on the Internet from various sources.

_npm install webpack --save-dev_
